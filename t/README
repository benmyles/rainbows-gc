= \Rainbows! test suite - YES OUR TEST SUITE IS CONCURRENT!

These are all integration tests that start the server on random, unused
TCP ports or Unix domain sockets.  They're all designed to run
concurrently with other tests to minimize test time, but tests may be
run independently as well.

We write our tests primarily in Bourne shell because that's what we're
comfortable writing integration tests with.  This test suite is also
easily portable to non-Ruby web servers.

== Requirements

* {Ruby 1.8 or 1.9}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/] (duh!)
* {isolate ~> 2.1.0}[http://github.com/jbarnette/isolate] - for dependencies
* {GNU make}[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/]
* {socat}[http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/]
* {curl >= 7.18.0}[http://curl.haxx.se/]
* standard UNIX shell utilities (Bourne sh, awk, sed, grep, ...)

We do not use bashisms or any non-portable, non-POSIX constructs
in our shell code.  We use the "pipefail" option if available and
mainly test with {ksh}[http://kornshell.com/], but occasionally
with {dash}[http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/] and
{bash}[http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/], too.

== Running Tests

*BSD users: use "gmake" instead of "make"

To run the entire test suite with 8 tests running at once:

  make -j8

To run one individual test for all concurrency models:

  make t0000-simple-http.sh

To run one individual test for one concurrency model:

  make Revactor.t0000-simple-http.sh

To run all tests for one concurrency model:

  make EventMachine

You may also increase verbosity by setting the "V" variable for
GNU make.  To disable trapping of stdout/stderr:

  make V=1

To enable the "set -x" option in shell scripts to trace execution

  make V=2

== Performance

Some of the tests are rather I/O intensive due to the rewindability
requirement of "rack.input" in the Rack specification and the somewhat
complicated (but awesome!) nature of the TeeInput class leading us to
test it very heavily.  If you have lots of RAM and a large tmpfs
partition, it is advisable to set your TMPDIR and also make the t/trash/
directory a symlink to a directory inside in your TMPDIR.
